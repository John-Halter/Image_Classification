# Image Classification
#### A butterfly image classifier using Tensorflow, Keras and Pycharm
#### Created by John Halter

## Description of Project
___
The following project uses a convolutional neural network to classify some of the most common butterflies in Colorado.
The reasons I wanted to make this type of project was to gain experience working with supervised learning models.
Another goal of mine was to create my own dataset from scratch to really comprehend the models output.
Using this personally created dataset, I wanted  to use Keras and Tensorflow to create a
convolutional neural network that could classify the following butterflies native to Colorado:
- Colorado Hairstreak
- Common Buckeye
- Monarch
- Red Admiral
- Rocky Mountain Parnassian
- Two-Tailed Swallowtail

## Software Used
___
- Python 3.10
- Pycharm 2021.3

## Project Structure:

### 1. Dataset Creation
___
The dataset was created using a module that scrapped bing images named 
[icrawler](https://icrawler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/builtin.html). This module has several parameters and with these
the different butterfly names and number of photos to extract would be used as input.
